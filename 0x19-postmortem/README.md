### Incident Report: The Great API Traffic Jam ðŸš¦

**Issue Summary:**
On August 20, 2024, from 14:00 to 15:45 UTC, our API service had a "minor" traffic jam that lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes. Imagine a herd of sheep trying to get through a single gateâ€”that's what happened to our API requests. About 80% of users were stuck outside the gate, unable to access the service, while the lucky 20% squeezed through but experienced some serious delays. The root cause? A load balancer that forgot how to share the workload.

### Timeline:

- **14:05 UTC**: ðŸš¨ *Alert! Alert!* Monitoring detected a nosedive in API response success rates. Panic level: 3/10.
- **14:10 UTC**: Engineers began investigating the API servers. "Is it the CPU? The memory? The gremlins again?"
- **14:20 UTC**: Additional alerts showed error rates spiking across multiple endpoints. Engineers began clutching their coffee mugs tighter.
- **14:25 UTC**: We blamed the new API update. Rollback initiated with the hope that it was the culprit.
- **14:30 UTC**: Rollback complete. Issue still there. Coffee mugs now empty, suspicion shifts to the database.
- **14:40 UTC**: Database was innocent. We checked the network firewallsâ€”no signs of foul play. Engineers began pointing fingers at each other.
- **14:50 UTC**: Network team called in for backup. "Guys, we need more eyes on this."
- **15:00 UTC**: Network team identified a suspicious traffic pattern. Load balancer configuration reviewed.
- **15:20 UTC**: *Bingo!* Misconfiguration found. All traffic was being funneled to one lonely server. Traffic control restored.
- **15:30 UTC**: Load balancer reconfigured, distributing traffic evenly like a well-organized marathon.
- **15:40 UTC**: Monitoring showed that the API was back to its usual snappy self.
- **15:45 UTC**: All systems go. Coffee break for everyone.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause was a "whoops" moment during a routine load balancer update, where the server pool setting was accidentally changed to route all traffic to a single backend server. This caused a traffic pile-up, resulting in an API slowdown that left most users stranded. 

The networking team swooped in and corrected the configuration, redistributing traffic across all servers in the pool. The fix was instantâ€”traffic flowed smoothly again, and users could finally get where they were going.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To avoid another traffic jam in our digital highway, weâ€™re implementing the following:

- **Configuration Review Process**: A new rule: two sets of eyes on all critical infrastructure changes. No more solo missions!
- **Automated Configuration Validation**: Scripts will now double-check our configurations before they go live. It's like a pre-flight checklist for our load balancers.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Weâ€™ll add monitoring to keep an eye on how our load balancer is sharing the load. If it starts playing favorites again, weâ€™ll know.
- **Incident Response Training**: Time to brush up on our load balancer troubleshooting skills. Weâ€™ll be ready if this happens again (but it wonâ€™t).

### Task List:
- [ ] Write a script to automatically validate load balancer configs.
- [ ] Set up monitoring for load balancer traffic distribution.
- [ ] Update our peer-review process to include configuration changes.
- [ ] Schedule a training session on incident response for load balancer issues
